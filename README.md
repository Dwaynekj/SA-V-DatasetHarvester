## - Download the [SA-V Dataset](https://ai.meta.com/datasets/segment-anything-video/)
*Introduced in [SAM 2: Segment Anything in Images and Videos Paper](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/sam-2-segment-anything-in-images-and-videos/) / [Code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything-2)*
1. Fill this [Meta document](https://ai.meta.com/datasets/segment-anything-video-downloads/) out to get access to the URLs
2. Adapt the corresponding [download_SA_V.yaml](./scripts/SA_V/download_SA_V.yaml) with the URLs
3. Adapt the paths in [download_SA_V.py](https://github.com/Vujas-Eteph/DatasetHarvester/blob/6c785a019b467b36622d348fb4f87f4256f960ba/scripts/SA_V/download_SA_V.py#L44) - line 44
4. Run
     ```zsh
     cd scripts/SA_V/
     python download_SA_V.py
     ```
